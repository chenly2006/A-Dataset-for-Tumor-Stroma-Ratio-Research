# A-Dataset-for-Tumor-Stroma-Ratio-Research
This is a dataset created for the research of Tumor Stroma Ratio (TSR), which consists of a semantic segmentation dataset concentrating on tumor pixels and a breast cancer image dateset with TSR annotations.
In the folder "A-Dataset-for-Tumor-Stroma-Ratio-Research/figures/", several examples of pixel-wise annotations based on TCGA dataset for the breast cancer tumor pixels are reserved, which are displayed as follows.

Meanwhile, we also provide some examples of core tumor region annotations based on real cases we collect in the folder "A-Dataset-for-Tumor-Stroma-Ratio-Research/figures-core-tumor-regions/", which are displayed as follows.
